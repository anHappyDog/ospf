# Ospf implementation in Rust based on linux

This is a simple implementation of ospf internal route protocol in rust, you can compile it by command:

```shell
cargo build
```

then use this command:

```shell
cargo run
```

after things all done, you need to configure the set of the interfaces and run the ospf process.
